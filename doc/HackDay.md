# DISCUS Hackday 25/02/2021

Extreme weather and coastal erosion are global challenges faced by people living on seashores, especially poor/marginal fishers.

Prof. Filippo Osella and his team in the Global Studies School, are looking to provide early warnings of extreme weather events on the coast of South India. In this multidisciplinary project we seek to assess the possible relationship between extreme weather events and coastal erosion patterns over the same area on the southern Indian coast.

To do this we need to be able to map the coastal shoreline from historic remote sensing data.

The aim for this hackday is to come up with a way of detecting the shoreline from historic remote sensing data and build up a dataset detailing how the shoreline has changed over time. We will be using the Google Earth Engine, along with the CoastSat Python module to try and accomplish this task.

## Main Objectives:
The Kerala Coastaline is hundreds of miles long, so we will start by focusing on one area in particular, the southernmost district of Kerela, Thiruvananthapuram. There’ve been some interesting changes on the coast there over the past decade or so.

In regard to the mapping the changes with time, we’re particularly interested in:
 
 * 2017 (storm year),
 * 2018 (intense rains, high waves) and possibly 2019. 
 * It may also be interesting to look at seasonal beach gain and loss (on either side of monsoon season that’s June-August) and annual trends. The 2017 storm was in November, though.
 * a freak event in 2018 April as a result of a remote storm in the Southern Ocean. 
 * if there’s scope to do longer-term mapping, a 30-year outlook could be very interesting. We can later link it to the local climatology (of wind and waves thereby making a statement about climate change).
 
 Other things to possibly look at:
 * Comparison of shoreline detection using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 7 (or 8) data.
 
 ### Stretch Goal
 Ideally, we should take into account the tides (although from my own quick investigation tidal height changes are quite small compared to Sussex, i.e. on the order of 40cm)
 
 If good progress is made on other objectives, some investigation into research into obtaining and using tidal information would be great!
